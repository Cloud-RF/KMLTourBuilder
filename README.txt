KML TOUR BUILDER 

Place the PHP script on a web server then create an adjacent writable folder called 'kmltours'.
The script has a simple HTML form for latitude,longitude,radius and altitude.

If it doesn't work, check permissions on the folder or add 'die($kml);' before the file write to see the KML in your web browser.

Each KML comes with embedded instructions on how to configure Google earth to get the best out of your tour.

Enjoy.
